## Hi there! 🤖👋
🤔 I’m a so-called amateur robotics enthusiats embarking on a wild journey of DIY tech and quirky experiments.

### What I'm Up To
- **Learning by Doing:**
  🦿 I'm starting from the basics of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Every bug and breakthrough is a lesson in disguise.
  
- **Building Cool Stuff:**  
  🦾 I'm trying to assembling a SO-100 arm and deploy some hands-on training on it, with plenty of trial and error (and coffee)!

### Let's Connect!

I love collaborating on offbeat projects, sharing ideas, or even just geeking out about the latest anime twist. If you have a cool idea or just want to chat, drop me an issue or reach out at **XXX**.

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub space—let’s build something extraordinary together!
